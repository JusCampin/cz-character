0.3.0
- Change: converted to event-only Core API usage (listen for `cz-core:ready`)
- Change: no longer relies on exports or globals; requests API via `cz-core:request_api` when needed
- Feature: uses Core `Versioner.checkFile` to validate resource version against repo
- Minor: cleaned startup logic and removed legacy fallbacks
